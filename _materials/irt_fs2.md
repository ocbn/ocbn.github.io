## Info

The materials which are accessible with the link given above used in my research study which is submitted to an international conference and now under review!

The online repo includes the flowchart of our evaluation as well as the results of our extensive experiments involving different FS methods including IRT-based FS variants.

The aim of the study is to provide an insight on the use of IRT-based FS variants on text datasets under different circumstances.

I am currently a postdoc scholar at LBNL working with Prof. Kristin Persson to
study battery electrolytes using machine learning techniques.

I obtained my Ph.D. in *Solid Mechanics* from the Department of Aerospace
Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Minnesota.
Supervised by Prof. Ellad Tadmor, I worked on developing both physics-based and
machine learning interatomic potentials for 2D materials (e.g. graphene and
MoS2) and applied them to study the structural, mechanical, and thermal
properties of 2D materials.
